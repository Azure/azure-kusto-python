### Prerequisites

1. Set up Python version 3.7 or higher on your machine. For instructions, consult a Python environment setup tutorial, like [this](https://www.
   tutorialspoint.com/java/java_environment_setup.htm).

### Instructions

1. Download the **DOWNLOAD_LINK** as a ZIP file.
1. Extract the app source code.
1. Open a command line window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the script.
1. Run `python -m pip install azure-kusto-data azure-kusto-ingest`. If upgrading, append ` --upgrade`.
1. Run `python kusto_sample_app.py`. It will already be configured to your cluster and source.

### Troubleshooting

* If you are having trouble running the script from your IDE, first check if the script runs from command line, then consult the troubleshooting references of your IDE.
