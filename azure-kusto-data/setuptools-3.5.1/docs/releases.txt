Release Process
===============

In order to allow for rapid, predictable releases, Setuptools uses a
mechanical technique for releases. The release script, ``release.py`` in the
repository, defines the details of the releases, and is executed by the
`jaraco.packaging <https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.packaging>`_ release
module. The script does some checks (some interactive) and fully automates
the release process.

A Setuptools release manager must have maintainer access on PyPI to the
project and administrative access to the BitBucket project.

Release Managers
----------------

Currently, the project has one release manager, Jason R. Coombs.
