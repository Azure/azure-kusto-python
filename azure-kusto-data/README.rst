========================================

Overview
--------

.. code-block:: python

    from azure.kusto.data import KustoClient, KustoConnectionStringBuilder

    cluster = "<insert here your cluster name>"
    client_id = "<insert here your AAD application id>"
    client_secret = "<insert here your AAD application key>"
    authority_id = "<insert here your AAD tenant id>"

    kcsb = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_aad_application_key_authentication(cluster, client_id, client_secret, authority_id)
    client = KustoClient(kcsb)

    db = "Samples"
    query = "StormEvents | take 10"

    response = client.execute(db, query)
    for row in response.primary_results[0]:
        print(row[0], " ", row["EventType"])



*Kusto Python Client* Library provides the capability to query Kusto clusters using Python.
It is Python 3.x compatible and supports
all data types through familiar Python DB API interface.

It's possible to use the library, for instance, from `Jupyter Notebooks
<http://jupyter.org/>`_.
which are attached to Spark clusters,
including, but not exclusively, `Azure Databricks
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/databricks/>`_. instances.
