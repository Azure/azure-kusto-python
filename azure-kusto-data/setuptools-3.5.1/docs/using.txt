Using Setuptools in your project
================================

To use Setuptools in your project, the recommended way is to ship
`ez_setup.py` alongside your `setup.py` script and call
it at the very beginning of `setup.py` like this::

    from ez_setup import use_setuptools
    use_setuptools()
