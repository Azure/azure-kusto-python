2,4147861,19,"Richard Matthew Clark was born and raised in southeastern, NC, in a small town called, Chadbourn, NC.  He has a tragic tale filled with emotion that becomes one with the canvas he paints. Clark has a way through any media to lead you into a world that traps your soul.  His mother left him at six months old and his dad that's drinking almost destroyed the both of them.  His mother came back into his life when he was twelve only to attempt to murder him.  Art was his only outlet to express his emotion. His senior year in High School he excelled in the arts and was offered a full scholarship to the Parsons School of Art and the Art Institute, as well as, an internship with Marvel and Disney.  The light at the end of the tunnel was soon dimmed as he had to put his dad in a rehab clinic and drop out of school to save their home.  He saved their home but soon after his father was released from rehab his dad furious of being admitted into the treatment center, gave the home up any way and the two went their separate ways.  With no one to seek shelter with Clark found himself sleeping in a cemetery on a cement tomb staring at the sky seeking a way out.  He went to a local community college during the day where he obtained his adult high school diploma and joined the United States Army.  He found himself joining the military where he fought in the Infantry and forever tried to find a way back to the path to use his art. He is the type of person that has faced trial after trial but no matter how many times he has been knocked to the ground he has always managed to summon the strength to stand back up and face whatever the powers that be had to throw at him.  Trying to have a real family for once he married at 18 and had 2 sons by 21. His wife turned out to be just like his mom and ended up walking out on the family and never looking back.  He was a single father and left the military where he would sell sketches and paint murals for income.  3 years past and he built a sign and graphics company and then married a female that tried to take what he had worked so hard to build. They had one child together and during the divorce proceeding the wife told the judge ""Sir he can have the child I just want the money!"" Clark threw the keys to her from across the court room and kept his 3 sons together.  He lost everything again but then kept the thing that mattered most....his children.  With just an airbrush left he went to the beaches of the Carolina's and started painting t-shirts for money. This fine artist that seemed to channel the spirits of the masters had been reduced to doing whatever it took art wise to eat.  He found himself working night and day to provide for everyone and with the street smarts he possessed he managed to turn money over and open an airbrush shop in the mall. Three years past and he met a bi racial girl that was born and raised in Germany. They dated for a while and she seemed to be the only one that could tame the battle tossed artist.  They were married in 2005 and now Clark finally has his family and now with four sons.  Although, Clark, has been through so much he always remains positive and humble and true to his southern charm. His work is able to captivate people from all walks of life and crosses over to all races, religions and backgrounds. His art is now world wide and his clients include everyone from the Ruff Ryderz, Warren Sapp and the Hollywood Elite.  Mr. Clark does everything from acting, producing, writing screenplays, set painting, special effects make up, music; and even owns custom body shops and mall stores, as well as, his own Production Company.  Born and raised in the Carolina's of the United States he is a hardened and battle tossed soul that still displays the characteristics of a leader. One that does not drink or use drugs; he stands as a knight making sure others do not have to struggle and feel the pain that he has known.","Tesha Dockery ""germanpheonix@yahoo.com"""

The band members were: Aimee Mann (vocals/bass), Robert Holmes (vocals/guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums). Their music was distinguished by Mann's beautiful vocals, exceptionally literate lyrics, thoughtful and mature subject matter, and rich, lovely melodies. 'Til Tuesday started out playing around the Boston area and won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble battle of the bands contest in 1983. They subsequently signed with the label Epic Records and released their debut album ""Voices Carry"" in 1985. The haunting and poignant titular tune was a substantial hit single; it peaked at #8 on the Billboard pop radio charts. The album also sold well; it reached #19 on the Top 20 album charts. Moreover, the music video for ""Voices Carry"" won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Alas, the band's follow-up 1986 album ""Welcome Home"" was less successful; it barely cracked the Top 50 at #49 on the Billboard album charts. The moving song ""What About Love"" did a little better; it went all the way to #26 on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although their third and final album ""Everything's Different Now"" received positive notices from music critics in 1988, it nonetheless was a complete commercial flop. 'Til Tuesday broke up in 1988. Aimee Mann has since gone on to have a hugely successful solo career while Michael Hausman serves as Mann's manager.",woodyanders

From MTV to BET to ABC to Source All Access (Nationally Syndicated) to Interscope Presents the Next Episode (on Showtime), the multi-talented producer has paid his dues and the payoff is set for the year 2004. Born Todd Brown, the Brooklyn native showed early promise during his school years and definitely stood out amongst the crowd. He lists early rap stars KRS-One and LL Cool J as major musical influences and by age 16, he had begun to rap professionally. But although he desired a music career, Todd went off to college.  While studying Cable and Corporate Communications, Todd got his first taste of Television production. He took everything from `Speech' to `Remote TV Production' to `Physics of Music'. One day a fellow student came into class wearing a suit and told him about an internship interview that he was going to. He gave him the phone number and his call led to an internship with a growing company called MTV.  Rising from intern to production assistant to associate producer, Todd knew that he found his niche. He quickly bonded with Ted Demme, who took him on as his apprentice. During this time, the music world was revving its engines and the rise of prominent hip-hop and R&B groups were beginning to take over the charts. The show, MTV's 'Fade to Black' (which would later spawn the hit show 'MTV Jams') achieved strong ratings with Todd himself as the offbeat host, proved to be a real learning experience. Having worked with such premiere artists as Babyface, Janet Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, TLC and Queen Latifah, it was a short time before he received the call to work at BET. Although he spent less than two years there, BET proved to be another stepping stone for the passionate Todd-1.  After a brief stint setting up the foundation for a Mike Tyson record label, Todd hooked up with friend and NBA star Derrick Coleman to form 44 Ways entertainment. Described it as a `full-service entertainment conglomerate which will catered to Music, Television and Film' Todd-1 had his plate full running the day to day operations. 2 years later, Todd returned to his roots as a Producer of Hip Hop Television shows taking on the post of Supervising Producer at the nationally syndicated show - ""Source All Access"". It was during the hiatus of this show that he wrote his first screenplay entitled ""Money Boys"".  Currently Todd is the Producer of ""Interscope Presents The Next Episode"", airing on Showtime Networks. This is the first of its kind, Hip Hip docu-drama delving into the lives of future rap stars. Todd has relocated to Los Angeles and is looking forward to the upcoming challenges that await.",Todd 1

The members were: Cal Everett (bass/lead vocals), George Pittaway (guitar/vocals), Jeff Severson (keyboards/guitars/vocals), and Tom Ballew (drums/vocals). 4 Out of 5 Doctors released their self-titled debut album in 1980. The group not only toured with Hall & Oates, Richie Blackmore, and Pat Travers, but also opened for such artists as The Clash, The Cars, Cyndi Lauper, Steppenwolf, and Jim Carroll. They contributed the songs ""Not from Her World"" and ""Baby Go Bye Bye"" to the soundtrack of the spooky and offbeat supernatural shocker ""The Boogeyman."" Moreover, 4 Out of 5 Doctors appear as themselves and perform the songs ""Mr. Cool Shoes,"" ""Modern Man,"" ""Waiting for a Change,"" ""Dawn Patrol,"" and ""Waiting for Roxanne"" at a party in the superior slasher horror cult favorite ""The House on Sorority Row."" The group scored 82 in the ""Rate-a-Record"" segment on Dick Clark's ""American Bandstand."" The band released their sophomore album ""Second Opinion"" in 1982. When that album proved to be an undeserved commercial flop, they subsequently broke up in 1984. On July 20, 2008 4 Out of 5 Doctors reunited for a well-received sold-out show at the Jammin' Jive club in Vienna, Virginia. The group also performed at the 2008 Wammie Awards at the State Theatre in Falls Church, Virginia on February 15, 2009. The band released the compilation albums ""Reconstructed"" in 2008 and ""Post Ops"" in 2009. 4 out of 5 Doctors issued the CD ""Cruel and Unusual"" in 2010.

240,300,19,"Cali rapper 40 Glocc is living the dream. He is signed to a deal with lifetime friends Mobb Deep - with whom he is about to embark on a national tour - on Infamous/G-Unit Records. He's recording his first album under that deal with some of the top producers in the business (Dr Dre, Alchemist, Havoc) and is traveling to places in the world he once only dreamed of seeing. It would seem that he has everything right now that an aspiring artist could ever want, and that is certainly true; but it certainly wasn't always that way. This is definitely no overnight success story.  Born as Tory Gasaway in Galveston, Texas, 40 Glocc didn't know his mother until the age of 8. Instead, he was raised by his grandparents in Beaumont, along with 14 other children. His father was never around much either. During those eight years, 40 only knew his mother, and a younger sister he had never met, by the pictures his grandparents showed him. He only knew that they lived in California and that one day, his mother was coming to get him. His grandmother told him so.  She did in fact come to get him and moved him to the MacArthur Park area of Downtown Los Angeles. 40 was so glad to see her and his sister, and he just knew that life was going to get better now that his family was reunited. After a time the family relocated to Colton City, San Bernadino, to an area also known as ""The Zoo"" and the problems at home began. 40 and his mother didn't get along at all. He didn't feel that she cared at all about what happened to him. His new friends did though and 40 started spending all of his time with them. His friends, unfortunately, were all members of the Colton City Crips. The deeper 40 got into that lifestyle, and its ensuing traps, the worse things became at home. Finally, at the age of 13, 40 left home for good, choosing instead to sleep in the cars of friends, or outside of grocery stores with the bums. It was a life he became adept at dealing with. His role models and father figures, such as they were, were gang bangers and drug dealers and 40 learned to survive through them and live by their street code, reaping all the rewards such a life inevitably has in store. Among other things, 40 was shot several times, ending up in a wheelchair for many months after one such incident during which he was shot by police. He finally caught a case from a home invasion charge he didn't commit. A charge it took him six months to beat.  Through all of this though, 40 did have a dream. He also had a talent, that of rapping, and of telling vivid stories of the things he had been through and of his life on the streets. Narratives that people could relate to. People like him. Word didn't take long to reach the right ears; the streets are like that. By '97 group The Zoo Crew (40 Glocc, K-9 and Natural Born) had formed and were dropping their first album ""Migrate, Adapt or Die"" produced by Tony and Julio G. The album became an underground hit and 40 was recognized as one of the best hidden talents in the streets. Soon he was an integral part of the scene and recording with his West Coast peers. It was his manager and long-time friend Storm though that negotiated his first solo deal with Empire Music Werks who were distributed by BMG. It was through this deal that 40 Glocc released his first solo effort, ""The Jackal"" which featured a who's who list of West Coast talent - Ras Kass, Bad Azz, Kurupt, Spice 1 and Tray Dee - and production from the best Cali had to offer; long-time supporter Dr Dre, Battle Cat and Protégé. Empire didn't have their promotion game up to snuff though and after sinking much of what he had been advanced back into promoting the album himself, 40 decided to go his own way.  At this time, manager Storm's other act, Mobb Deep had been making a lot of noise since their debut ""Infamous"" on Jive and it was only natural that they would take an interest in the career of their friend. First instincts said get 40 a deal at Jive but conversations went nowhere and Storm began to shop 40 Glocc at the other majors. Unfortunately, the West Coast had lost their hold on the rap game and no one wanted to take a chance that a West Coast artist could sell. It was a set-back, as was Jive's dropping of Mobb Deep but as life often so does, things took a sudden turn for the great. Mobb Deep was signed to G-Unit and suddenly they and their friend 40 Glocc were running around with rap's finest. This was a home 40 could live with and it wasn't long before that became a reality; he signed to Mobb Deep's imprint Infamous under G-Unit. Some things have remained the same however. 40 is still recording with Dr Dre and he is still writing stories that people his can relate to. That is his goal. To give hope with his lyrics to people who are coming up through some of what he has already lived to tell. To let them know that they too can achieve their dream. To believe in themselves when there is no one else to believe in you.  40 Glocc is pursuing acting as well. He recently wrapped a supporting role in a feature film entitled ""Playboys"" from directors Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore (""The Whitest Kids U Know""). He's also featured in a new AFI (American Film Institute) short film called ""The Second Half"". Being a part of a prestigious AFI Film was a great experience for him. 40 Glocc has also appeared in other feature films such as ""Thicker Than Blood"", ""Book Of Love"" and Snoop Dogg's ""Tha Eastsidaz"".  With what he has already accomplished, what are some of 40 Glocc's other dreams? To make an album that touches peoples' souls. He feels that what he is recording now is his best work ever. He knows he can't rap forever though. He also hopes to make his label Zoo Life something he can grow old with. After all, right now, just the thought that he has made it to a point in his life where he probably will live to grow old is a major blessing.",Keith Louis Brown

363,339,19,"Born in the South Jamaica section of Queens, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson has lived in New York City all his life. Raised by his grandparents after his father ran out and his mother was shot when he was only eight. Growing up, the Queens rapper originally wanted to be a heavyweight boxer, but eventually fell back on rapping. DJs had taken it upon themselves to release two Best of 50 Cent mix CDs, before he had even signed to a major label. 50 Cent hit the scene with ""How To Rob"" and he's been on a rampage ever since dealing with bootleggers, label back stabbing and other platinum selling artists trying to get at him physically. In 1999 his album Power of the Dollar, was heavily bootlegged and Trackmasters/Columbia never released it. Supposedly, Trackmasters weren't comfortable with him being caught up in the streets and getting shot three days before filming the video for ""Thug Love,"" (with Destiny's Child) -- his first single. 50 was shot three times that night, two shots hitting him in the head, the bullet that struck his face he carries as a reminder of what happened. That event led to the fall out with Columbia and negotiating his release from their grasps. He still showed love and rhymed over a Trackmasters produced remix of ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" on J-Lo's latest album, but rivals at Murder Inc. had 50 cut from the track which could have launched the rapper. This all changed in one night when Eminem said on a radio show that ""50 Cent is definitely my favorite rapper right now, he's the only one keeping it real."" The very next day a bidding war started on 50, ending when 50 signed to Eminem's very own label Shady/Aftermath. 50 Cent's fame has exploded, being produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem and finally making his debut album ""Get rich or Die Tryin'."" 50 has full access and advantage of the streets through mix-tapes; that's his forum because he controls it. 50 Cent is the most anticipated artist of 2003. It's well deserved because he's ""been patiently waiting.""",Rod Reece

A Taste of Honey started out playing at various clubs in Southern California and at American military bases in both the United States and abroad (the band did USO tours in such places as Spain, Alaska, Thailand, Morocco and Japan). The group were discovered by Capitol Records in 1976 and signed up with the label two years later. They scored a massive smash in 1978 with the infectiously funky disco song ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"", which peaked at #1 on the Billboard pop charts for three consecutive weeks, sold over two million copies, and earned the group a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 15, 1979. The follow-up song, ""Do It Good"", was a #13 hit on the R&B radio charts. By 1980, the band had become a duo consisting of only 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) and 'Hazel Payne' (qv). In 1981, A Taste of Honey had another huge success with their cover of the lovely Japanese ballad ""Sukiyaki"", which soared to #1 on the R&B radio charts and climbed all the way to #3 on the Billboard pop charts. The band broke up in the early 80s. 'Janice Marie Johnson' (qv) went on to pursue a solo career, 'Hazel Payne' (qv) became an international stage actress, Donald Ray Johnson has recorded several blues albums and continues to play the drums (he's also a well-known blues singer/drummer in Western Canada), and Perry Kibble sadly died of heart failure at the tragically young age of 49 in 1999.

Stardom, however, was assured after nabbing the role of the famous dog's young master on the ""Rin Tin Tin"" series.

She studied at Aalborghus Gymnasium, but dropped out to - as she says - study life instead.  She released her first album ""Lille filantrop"" (""Little philanthropist"") in 2008, and her second album ""Missinær"" (""Missionary"") in 2010 on Playground Records. Both produced by Henrik Marstal. Both albums were very well received by Danish reviewers. Five and six stars pretty much all over, but none of the albums gave her a massive radio-hit. ""Tyk"" (""Fat"") from the first album gave her enough attention to fill the small concert-halls, and the title-track from ""Missionær"" was a regular on the national Danish radio a few months after release. A third album will be released in 2012.  In 2009 she won the acclaimed award ""Steppeulven"" as best, upcoming act.  Annika was cast for the world's first theatre-musical ""Come Together"", entirely based on The Beatles songs.

784,1739753,19,"Talented. Beautiful. Modest. These three words described R&B singer-turned-actress Aaliyah perfectly. Born in Brooklyn, New York but raised in Detroit, Aaliyah got her first major exposure appearing on the syndicated television series _""Star Search"" (1983)_ (qv) where she awed the audience with her amazing voice and talent. Withdrawing from the celebrity scene for a few years, Aaliyah lived the life of a normal teenage girl, attending Detroit's Performing Arts High School where she majored in dance. It was around this same time that Aaliyah met singer/composer 'R. Kelly' (qv). Kelly assisted Aaliyah with the production of her debut album ""Age Ain't Nothing But A number"" which scored several number hits, specifically ""Back and Forth."" The album's title was a brief reference to her short-lived marriage to 'R. Kelly' (qv) (she was 15 years of age at the time, and he was in his 20s). Thir marriage was annulled due to her status as a minor. During her senior year, Aaliyah went on to record ""One In A Million"" which featured the songwriting talents of major R&B producers/writers 'Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott' (qv) and 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). That album was a major success and sealed Aaliyah's fame forever. After seeing her at an awards show and in the video for her hit song ""Are You that Somebody?"" (from the 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv) film _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv)), film producer 'Joel Silver (I)' (qv) (producer of _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv) and other major actor films) asked Aaliyah to audition for a role in an upcoming romance/action film called _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv). With her determination and sex appeal, Aaliyah won Silver over and was cast in her first major film role. _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv) was a hit at the box office. This film led to her being cast as one of the stars of the film based on 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv)'s _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) and in the two sequels to the major box office hit, _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv). During the busy schedule of her film career, Aaliyah took time to record her third album, the self-titled ""Aaliyah"". July 2001 was a busy time for Aaliyah. After the sucess of her song ""Try Again"" for which she was nominated for a Grammy Award and won several MTV Video Awards, Aaliyah finally released her ""Aaliyah"" album. Debuting at number two on the Billboard charts, ""Aaliyah"" was a sales success despite many lack-lustre reviews it received. In August 2001, Aaliyah took time off from her busy album promotional tour to fly to the Bahamas to film a video for the song ""Rock the Boat"". The video, filmed on Abaco Island, was directed by 'Hype Williams' (qv), a major music video director known for his style and wit. On August 25, 2001, after filming the video, Aaliyah and about 9-11 of her entourage took off from Marsh Harbour airport at 6:50pm EDT in a small Cessna 404 en route to Opa-Locka, Florida. A few minutes after take-off, the plane crashed about 200 feet from the runaway killing Aaliyah and many others instantly. Four passnegers were pulled alive from the wreckage, and one later died at a hospital in Nassau. Aaliyah was only 22 years old. Aaliyah's short-lived, but brillant career was a true success story for a young African-American woman who went against all odds to be herself in an industry where originality is scarce. Truly missed by her family, friends, and fans, her music and film contributions will live forever.",Luis32789@aol.com
785,1739753,19,"On January 16th 1979 the world was blessed with the birth of Aaliyah Dana Haughton in Brooklyn, New York. Aaliyah was raised by her father, mother and brother 'Rashad Haughton' (qv) in Detroit. At age 9 she appeared on _""Star Search"" (1983)_ (qv), the TV program and sang ""My Funny Valentine"", a song which her mother had sung years earlier. At age 11, she sang with 'Gladys Knight' (qv) in a five-night stint in Las Vegas. In 1992, she began to work on her debut album with the help of singer 'R. Kelly' (qv). The album, ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"" was released in 1994 and received heavy praise. Aaliyah came under attack shortly after when reports suggested she was married to 'R. Kelly' (qv). At the time, she was 15, he was 27. The marriage was apparently annulled. In 1995, she began to work on her 2nd album, alongside 'Jermaine Dupri' (qv), 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv), 'Slick Rick (I)' (qv) and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott'. The album, titled 'One In A Million' was released on August 27th 1996. In 1998 she released the single, 'Are you that somebody?' from the _Doctor Dolittle (1998)_ (qv) soundtrack, it was produced by her friends 'Tim Mosley (I)' (qv). Later that year she released the single 'Journey to the past', from the _Anastasia (1997)_ (qv) soundtrack. In 2000, she made her film acting debut and starred as Trish O'Day in the smash hit, hip-hop, kung fu film, _Romeo Must Die (2000)_ (qv) alongside 'Jet Li' (qv). The producer was so impressed by her performance she got parts in _The Matrix Reloaded (2003)_ (qv) and _The Matrix Revolutions (2003)_ (qv). She made numerous records for the soundtrack and released 'Try Again', for which she was nominated with 'Best female video' and 'Best Video in a film' with MTV. In 2001 she was nominated with 2 awards for MTV, the 'Breakthrough female' and 'best performing female'. In July 2001 she released her third album, the self-titled, 'Aaliyah'. In early August of the same year she filmed the video for the single 'More Than a woman', taken off the album and on the 23rd August she started filming for 'Rock The Boat', on Abaco Island, in the Bahamas. On 25th August, filming was completed and her and eight of her crew members including her hair stylist and bodyguard boarded a small plane. Shortly after take off, the plane crashed and exploded, Aaliyah and all on board, perished. Aaliyah's funeral was held on Friday August 31st in New York, and 22 white doves were flown to celebrate each year of her life. Soon after her death, the hit singles 'More Than a woman' and 'Rock The Boat' were released from her third album. In 2002, the film _Queen of the Damned (2002)_ (qv) by 'Anne Rice (I)' (qv) was released in which Aaliyah played the lead, Queen Akasha. She was nominated for best Villain at the MTV movie awards 2002. Looking back at her biography, it's no wonder her name means 'Highest, most exhalted one; the best', she had achieved so much in her short life of 22 years.",James Bryant

875,664,19,"Alvar Aalto, one of Finland's most famous people who reshaped architecture and furniture of public buildings on the basis of functionality and organic relationship between man, nature and buildings, is now called the ""Father of Modernism"" in Scandinavian countries.  He was born Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto, on February 3, 1898, in Kuortane, Finland (at that time Finland was part of Russian Empire). He was the first of three children. His father, J. H. Aalto, was a government surveyor. His mother, Selma Hackestedt, was of Swedish ancestry, she died in 1903. His father remarried and moved the family to the town of Jyvaskyla. There young Aalto attended the Normal School and the Classical Gymnasium, graduating in 1916. During the summer months, young Aalto accompanied his father on surveying trips. From 1916-1921 he studied at the Helsinki University of technology, graduating with a degree in architecture. While a student, Aalto worked for Carolus Lindberg on the design of the ""Tivoli"" area for the 1920 National Fair. At that time Aalto was a protégé of Armas Lingren, partner of E. Saarinen during the formative period of Finnish National architecture of Romanticism. Aalto served in the Finnish National Militia during the Civil War that followed after the Russian Revolution, when the nation of Finland gained independence from Russia.  In 1922-1923 Aalto worked for a project in Sweden, he collaborated with A. Bjerke on the design of the Congress Hall for the 1923 World Fair in Goteborg. He also designed several buildings for the 1922 Industrial fair in Tampere. In 1923 Aalto opened his first architectural office in Juvaskyla. In 1924 he married architect Aino Marsio, they had two children, Johanna (born 1925), and Hamilkar (born 1928). Aalto and his wife had their honeymoon in Italy. The Mediterranean culture made a profound influence on Aalto's creativity, it blended with his Nordic intellect and remained important to his visionary works for the rest of his life. The simple massing and ornamentation of the ""architettura mirwire"" of Northern Italy translated into Aalto's style with its balanced proportions, harmonious volumes rendered in stucco or wood, and sparse decoration with selective use of classical elements. In 1927 the Aaltos moved to the city of Turku. There Alvar Aalto designed the Paimio Sanatorium, a building that elevated him to the status of master of heroic functionalism. He soon moved forward in his pursuit of artistic harmony through organic integration of people and buildings with the environment. Such was his design for the Villa Mairea (1938) in Noormarkku, one of the most admired private residences in contemporary architecture.  In 1933 Aalto moved to Helsinki. There he founded his architecture firm ""Artek"" where he executed his major international commissions, such as Finnish Pavilions for the 1936 Paris World Fair and the 1939-1940 New York's World Fair, libraries in Oregon, USA, and Finland, Opera House in Essen, Germany. His other significant buildings included Baker House at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., USA, Central University Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia, Helsinki Institute of Technology, North Utland Art Museum in Denmark, Nordic House in Reykjavic, Iceland, Public Library in Vyborg, (now Russia), and many other buildings. His later masterpieces include the municipal building in Sayanasalo (1952), the Vuoksenniska Church (1959) and the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki. His works exhibit a range of innovative ideas presented with comforting clarity and carefully crafted balance of intricate and complex forms, spaces, and elements, that are integrated in a simple and well-proportioned way. Aalto's design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York's World Fair was described as ""work of genius"" by 'Frank Lloyd Wright (I)' (qv).  Functionalism and synthetic attitude were important in Aalto's evolution from Nordic Classicism towards Modernism. He created his own way of converging forms, materials, and purpose of his buildings on the rationale of their functionality, aesthetics, and comfortable use. Aalto's architecture, furniture, glassware and jewelery evokes multiple allusions to images of unspoiled nature, thus making an ennobling influence on public behavior. He designed 70 buildings for the town of Jyvaskyla, 37 of which were realized, such as the Institute of Pedagogy (1953-1957) and other public buildings. Aalto's ecological awareness was epitomized in his design of the Sunila Cellulose Industry and the residential village for employees (1936 - 1939) and its second stage (1951 - 1954). Aalto's creativity was deeply rooted in his own organic way of life, traditional for the people in Scandinavian countries. ""The very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in architecture"" said Alvar Aalto.  Alvo Aalto was Chairman of the Arcitects Union and President of the Finnish Academy. His latest building for the Art Museum in Jyvaskyla was named after him. His awards included the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (1957) and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects (1963). Alvar Aalto was featured on the last series of the 50 Finnish mark bill, before the Euro. He died of natural causes on May 11, 1976, in Helsinki and was laid to rest in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki, Finland.",Steve Shelokhonov

980,1739801,19,"Angela Aames grew up in Pierre, South Dakota. She acted in high school and attended the University of South Dakota before coming to Hollywood in 1978 to begin her acting career. Her first film role was as Little Bo Peep in the film _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv). She followed that up by playing Linda ""Boom-Boom"" Bang in _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv). Other film roles included _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv), _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv), _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv), and _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv). She did guest appearances on several television shows, including _""Cheers"" (1982)_ (qv) and _""Night Court"" (1984)_ (qv). Her last role was as Penny, a fitness instructor, on _""The Dom DeLuise Show"" (1987)_ (qv). Angela was found dead at a friend's home in West Hills in the San Fernando Valley on November 27, 1988. The coroner later ruled that her death was a result of a deterioration of the heart muscle, probably caused by a virus. She was 32 at the time.",Don Nelsen <kpaden@cobweb.net>
981,1739801,19,"Beautiful, buxom blond Angela Aames made her mark in Hollywood during the late 1970s and 1980s while appearing in a string of silly T & A comedies and exploitation movies. Additionally, she appeared on numerous TV shows in sexy bit parts that sadly amounted to little more than window dressing.  While she aspired to be a comedienne, her ample curves made her most suitable to play the series of voluptuous party girls and sex kittens that eventually would comprise her resume.  Angela was born February 27, 1956. An early resume indicates that, early, her thespian training included stints at the 'Lee Strasberg' (qv) Theatre Institute and 'Harvey Lembeck' (qv)'s Comedy Workshop, and stage appearances in such theatrical fare as ""Of Mice and Men"", ""The Lion in Winter"", ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"", ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", ""Tartuffe"", ""The Pleasure of his Company"", ""Dark of the Moon"" and ""The Women"".  In addition to Angela's verified credits as published at IMDb, her resume lists a number of other appearances in film and television including the 20-minute educational short called ""Malice in Bigotland"" as well as an industrial short for G.T.E. that dealt with sexual harassment. Also listed are appearances on the Telethon for Autistic Children and Krofft Supershows.  Her television work included bit parts in shows like _""Barnaby Jones"" (1973)_ (qv), _""Angie"" (1979)_ (qv), _""Out of the Blue"" (1979)_ (qv), _""Mork & Mindy"" (1978)_ (qv), _""Hill Street Blues"" (1981)_ (qv), _""Cheers"" (1982)_ (qv), _""Automan"" (1983)_ (qv) and _""Alice"" (1976)_ (qv), in addition to her recurring appearances on _""B.J. and the Bear"" (1978)_ (qv), _""The Fall Guy"" (1981)_ (qv) and _""Night Court"" (1984)_ (qv). All featured Angela in tight outfits with copious amounts of cleavage on display. In her _""Cheers"" (1982)_ (qv) appearance, in the episode called _""Cheers"" (1982) {Sam's Women (#1.2)}_ (qv), Angela plays her ""bimbo"" role with such skill that her spelling of her name, ""Brandee-with two E's"", is the show's funniest and most memorable line.  In 1983, she appeared on Cinemax's _Likely Stories, Vol. 4 (1983) (TV)_ (qv), playing an 80-foot tall, bikini-clad giantess.  Her earliest film role appears to have been _Fairy Tales (1978)_ (qv), in which she plays a sexier ""Little Bo Peep"" than you've probably seen before. Angela briefly appeared nude in this film, and clips of her nude scene later appeared in made-for-video compilations like _The Best of Sex and Violence (1981)_ (qv) and _Famous T & A (1982) (V)_ (qv). Taking one look at her, Angela was simply made to play the part of Linda ""Boom Boom"" Bangs in _H.O.T.S. (1979)_ (qv), which had her skydiving topless into a swimming pool, among other exploits that made effective use of her frontal anatomy. Her resume also lists an otherwise unknown film from this period, called ""The Crazy"".  Angela appeared in bit parts a number of made-for-TV movies in 1980-81 appearances, which mostly showcased her figure and which included ""Moviola"" (aka _This Year's Blonde (1980) (TV)_ (qv)), _Charlie and the Great Balloon Chase (1981) (TV)_ (qv), _The Comeback Kid (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and _The Perfect Woman (1981) (TV)_ (qv).  The early 1980s saw her topless again in _...All the Marbles (1981)_ (qv). She also appeared, briefly, in _Boxoffice (1982)_ (qv), as a pregnant Hollywood starlet at a posh dinner party. In 1983, Angela had a non-speaking walk-through part in _Scarface (1983)_ (qv).  In 1984, she had arguably her most memorable moment on-screen, in the now-cult classic 'Tom Hanks' (qv) vehicle _Bachelor Party (1984)_ (qv). During the film's opening credits, Aames appears in 'Adrian Zmed' (qv)'s photography studio as a mother having baby pictures taken of her infant child. With a red ""come get me"" top cut practically to her navel, she made indelible impressions on legions of adoring male fans.  Her later film roles, in the mid to late 1980s, included 'Jim Wynorski' (qv)'s _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), _Basic Training (1985)_ (qv) and _Chopping Mall (1986)_ (qv). _The Lost Empire (1985)_ (qv), in particular, allowed Angela to take more of a leading role, demonstrating her fine flair for comedy in addition to her big breasts. There are also some vague Internet references to an appearance in a 1988 ""documentary"" on bodybuilding called ""Flex"" (1988), and also starring Harry Grant and 'Tom Platz' (qv). This is certainly plausible, as Angela had reportedly taken up weightlifting in the years just before her untimely death.  In 1988, she had secured a starring role in the weekly sit-com _""The Dom DeLuise Show"" (1987)_ (qv), in which she portrayed an aerobics instructor who frequented the beauty and barber shop around which the show revolved. During the show's pilot episode, she made a spectacular entrance, clad in a skin tight leotard, during which 'Dom DeLuise' (qv) commented, to the audience, ""I just love watching her jog!""  In addition to her numerous TV and film appearances, Angela occasionally modeled. Notably, she was a ""Mint 400 Girl"" in 1982. The ""Mint 400 Girls"" were glamorous race beauty queens integrally involved in the publicity for the prestigious Mint 400 Las Vegas off-road race. She has been featured in a number of publications over the years, including Adam Magazine, Playboy, Partner, Variety, Celebrity Sleuth, Femme Fatales and the National Enquirer.  Angela died unexpectedly on November 27, 1988, of what was officially declared ""heart disease"". She was 32 years old. She is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Pierre, South Dakota, where she was born.  There were actresses who had better roles and who achieved more in their careers, but the fact that, despite her rather lightweight film roles, Angela's fans fondly remember her nearly twenty years after she left us speaks volumes about her cinematic legacy.",Brent Blackburn
